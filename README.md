This project was created as a way to familiarize myself with Next.js and build a fully functional finance tracker from scratch.

Users can add, edit, and delete transactions, track income vs expenses, and analyze data with interactive graphs. You can also sort transactions by category, create your own custom categories, and remove them if no longer needed.
Authentication is handled via Google login or manual registration. The design is fully responsive, working smoothly across desktop and mobile.

Features:

- ➕ Add / edit / delete transactions
- 🗂️ Sort and group by custom categories
- 🧹 Add and remove categories
- 📊 Income vs expense breakdown with interactive graphs
- 🔐 Login with Google or register manually
- 🌈 Clean and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
